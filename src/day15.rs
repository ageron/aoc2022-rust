/// Iterating through all 4 million rows works fine, and it's simple enough, but

/// to get the star, but it's not very satisfactory, so I looked for a more
/// efficient solution.
/// The location we're looking for must be surrounded by sensor ranges. So the
/// code looks for all the diagonal lines (NW-to-SE, and SW-to-NE) that are just
/// one cell outside of the sensor ranges. The solution must be located at the
/// intersection of one of the SW-to-NE lines and one of the NW-to-SE lines.
/// Each NW-to-SE line is defined by y = -x + offset Â± (radius + 1), and each
/// SW-to-NE line is defined by y = x + offset Â± (radius + 1)
/// So the code starts by looking for all the possible offsets, in each
/// direction. I used HashSets to remove duplicates.
/// We can then narrow the search by considering only the NW-to-SE lines that
/// are located at the SW of one range and also at the NE of another range.
/// Similarly we only consider the SW-to-NE lines that are located at the NW of
/// one range and also at the SE of another.
/// Then we look at all the intersections of the remaining SW-to-NE and NW-to-SE
/// lines, and we keep only the location that is not in range of any sensor.
/// Caveat: this algorithm fails if the distress beacon is located on one of the
/// borders, since it can be surrounded by only two sensor ranges (or just one
/// if it's in a corner). But Eric Wastl is a nice guy, he wouldn't do that...
/// would he?
/// Anyway, should this happen, it's easy enough to also check for the
/// intersection between all diagonal lines and the borders. It's just a bit
/// boring, so I didn't bother.
/// In the end, this algorithm now runs in 220Âµs. That's about 6000x faster! ðŸ˜ƒ
